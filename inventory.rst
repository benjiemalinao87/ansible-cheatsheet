Inventory
=========

.. _inventory-directory:

Inventory directory
--------------------------

Whatever directory the :ref:`inventory-file` is in.

.. _inventory-file:

Inventory file
------------------

Default
    ``/etc/ansible/hosts``

Change
    set ``ANSIBLE_HOSTS`` in environment

    ``ansible-playbook -i <inventoryfile> ...``

    set :ref:`hostfile` in configuration

Syntax
    .ini file, except initial lines don't need to be in a section

The inventory file is basically a list of hostnames or IP addresses,
one per line. Can include port with ``hostname:port`` or ``address:port``.

Ranges: Including ``[m:n]`` in a line will repeat the line for every
value from ``m`` through ``n``.  ``m`` and ``n`` can be numbers or letters.

Host :ref:`variables`: Can specify per-host options after hostname on the
same line.  E.g.  ``jumper ansible_ssh_port=5555
ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.50``.  See also :ref:`variables-files`.

Group :ref:`variables`: add ``[groupname:vars]`` section and put var definitions in it, one per line.  See also :ref:`variables-files`.

Groups of groups: add ``[newgroupname:children]`` and put other group names in it, one per line.

Dynamic inventory
-----------------

If the inventory file is executable, then instead of reading it
as a .ini file, Ansible will run it and use its output - but the
output is not in the same format as a non-executable .ini file would
be. See `the docs <http://docs.ansible.com/developing_inventory.html>`_
for all the details.

.. _host-spec:

Host specs
----------

You can build :ref:`host-conditionals` with a host spec,
also called a `pattern <http://docs.ansible.com/intro_patterns.html>`_
in Ansible.

All hosts:
    ``*`` or ``all``

One specific host:
    ``hostname`` or ``ipaddress``

One group:
    ``groupname``

Wildcard globs:
    ``*.example.com`` or ``127.0.*.3``

Regexes:
    ``~(web|db).example.com``

Expressions:

    ``spec1:spec2`` - all hosts matched by spec1 or spec2

    ``spec1:!spec2`` - hosts matched by spec1, except those matched by spec2

    ``spec1:&spec`` - hosts matched by both spec1 and spec2
