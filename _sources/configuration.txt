Configuration
=============

.. _configuration-file:

Configuration file
------------------------

Syntax
    .ini file

See `The Ansible Configuration File <http://docs.ansible.com/intro_configuration.html>`_.

Ansible uses the first config file it finds on this list:
    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)
    * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
    * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

 
Some useful vars in the ``[defaults]`` section:

.. _hostfile:

hostfile
........

    This is the default location of the inventory file, script, or directory that Ansible will use to determine what hosts it has available to talk to:

    hostfile = /etc/ansible/hosts

.. _roles-path:

roles_path
..........
    The roles path indicate additional directories beyond the ‘roles/’ subdirectory of a playbook project to search to find Ansible roles. For instance, if there was a source control repository of common roles and a different repository of playbooks, you might choose to establish a convention to checkout roles in /opt/mysite/roles like so:

        roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles

    Additional paths can be provided separated by colon characters, in the same way as other pathstrings:

        roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles:/opt/othersite/roles

    Roles will be first searched for in the playbook directory. Should a role not be found, it will indicate all the possible paths that were searched.
